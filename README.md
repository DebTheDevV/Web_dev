# 🌐 Sigma Web Dev Journey – by Debadrita

This repository documents my personal journey through the **Sigma Web Development Course by CodeWithHarry**. It's not just a collection of files — it's my daily commitment to mastering web development from the ground up.

Each folder reflects what I built, learned, and explored on that particular day. No shortcuts, no skipping. Just raw learning, hands-on practice, and progress — one line of code at a time.

## 💻 Why This Repo Exists

I'm building a strong foundation in web development through consistent daily practice. Instead of passive watching, I’m:
- Writing code from scratch
- Breaking things and fixing them
- Pushing every small win to this repo

This isn’t just coursework — it’s the start of something bigger.
